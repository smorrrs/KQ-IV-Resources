# Start Location
The game starts with Rosella on the beach screen on the top row of the main section (near the middle)

# Screen Transitions
By default, if Rosella hits the edge of the screen she will transition to the next screen in that direction if there are white lines connecting the screens, and she will retain a matching position on the new screen. Note that there is an invisible "horizon" partway up each screen that will trigger an upward transition. Horizons differ screen-to-screen

The main section is 5 screens tall, and will wrap around if you continue up or down. The map continues infinitely left with ocean screens, although Rosella will drown after swimming a handful of screens.

# Special Screen Transitions
Special loading zones are indicated with colored bars. Hitting a bar will move you to the corresponding bar of the same color on the adjacent screen. Rosella's position will be maintained as close as possible, unless there is a black dot in which case that dot is where she'll appear.

Some transitions are only one way. These are indicated by a black dot inside a larger colored dot.
