# Glitches & Skips
No major glitches or skips are known for the game, so any discovery found could be a game-changer. 

It's been said playing the lute/flute while transitioning screens can lead to strange behavior like nullifying deaths and walking out-of-bounds, but I haven't been able to reproduce this in the SCI version. Other items that have an animation (don crown, read book) may have a similar effect.

Walking into the feather then doing a save-reload will teleport Rosella one pixel into the feather. The same trick doesn't appear to work to get past doors.


# Theoretical Skips
## Quick Game Time Advancement
Idea: Find a way quickly progress the in-game time at will.

Usage: Activate night time via game time rather than the getPandoraBox phase + scarab + fruit trigger

Allows Skipping:
- Fruit
- Pipe
- Lute
- Book
- Visiting Mansion until ghost section
- Troll
- Board
- Lantern

Estimated Save: 3-5 min


## Crypt Door Skip
Idea: Find a way to get past the crypt door without the skeleton key

Allows Skipping:
- Skeleton Key
- Specifying "gold" when unlocking Lolotte's door
- Playing Organ
- Ghosts
- Triggering Night
- All things skipped in Quick Time Advancement Skip

Estimated Save: 5-10 min

Attempts: If the flute transition glitch really does work to move out-of-bounds (white pixels), you could flute glitch onto this screen and walk into the yellow loading zone.

## Early Castle
Idea: Find a way to avoid the goons at the mountain path and get to the castle early

Issue: Need to also find a way to get the gold key or get past Lolotte's door without it

Allows skipping everything exept:
- Bow
- (Gold Key)
- Amulet

Estimated Save: 15 min

Attempts: Setting the game to min speed and rushing up the path, you can just get halfway to the loading zone. The fall triggers on this screen are only 1 pixel wide, so one idea is to try to bypass them then run out-of-bounds to the backside of the loading zone.

## Desert Island Skip
Idea: Find a way to leave the desert island while bypassing either the fish, whistle, or the dolphin

Allows Skipping:
- Fish
- Pole
- Fisherman Cutscene
- Worm

Estimated Save: 1 min

Combined with any Fruit skip, allows skipping:
- Pouch
- Dwarf Cutscene

Estimated Save: 4 min

Attempts: The island is set 100 screens away from mainland, and Rosella drowns after 5 screens of swimming. Theoretically if you could bypass drowning you could swim 100 screens to the right, but taking 3 seconds per screen it would take 5 minutes to swim the entire distance (not including shark recovery time), so even with dwarf cutscene skip it still wouldn't be worth it.
