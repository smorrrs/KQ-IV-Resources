## Text Input 

## Synonyms & Efficient Phrasing
Each verb and noun understood by the text input parser has a list of synonyms it will accept in its stead, so choose the shortest and easiest to type synonym for each term. Also, most prepositions and prepositional phrases aren't required.

For example,
- Instead of "take pouch", you can type "get gem"
- Instead of "throw fish to pelican", you can type "give fish"

Notable Noun Replacements:
- pouch > gem
- portrait > picture
- latch > lock
- unicorn > horse
- lantern > lamp
- flute > pipe
- scarab > charm
- cabinet > door
- possessions > all
- talisman > amulet

Notable Verb Replacements:
- take > get 
- throw > give
- wear > don
- place > put
- jump > hop

Notable Phrase Replacements:
- clean house > tidy
- use feather on uvula > tickle
- blow whistle > toot
- swing axe > use ax
- put worm on pole > bait pole
- shoot lolotte > shoot bow

## Quick Typo Recovery
Hit ESCAPE to exit out of the input box, then start retyping your command from the beginning.

## Quick Re-Type
Hit SPACE to bring up the input box filled with the last text that was typed.

## Noun Stacking 
When using the same verb twice in a row, for the second command you can hit SPACE to retype the first command, hit SPACE again, then type the new noun. The parser will only read the last noun used, ignoring the noun of the first command.

For example, "get frog crown" will be interpreted as "get crown".

## Pronoun Replacement
When using the same noun twice in a row, for the second command you can replace the noun with "it". This even works 

For example,
- shoot horse = shoot arrow at unicorn
- bridle it = bridle horse
- ride it = ride horse

This still works with a nounless command used before the second command. For example,
- put board
- hop
- put it
