## Text Input 

### Synonyms & Efficient Phrasing
Each verb and noun understood by the text input parser has a list of synonyms it will accept in its stead, so choose the shortest and easiest to type synonym for each term. Also, most prepositional phrases aren't required.

For example,
- Instead of "take pouch", you can type "get gem"
- Instead of "throw fish to pelican", you can type "give fish"

Notable Replacements:
- pouch > gem
- latch > lock
- unicorn > horse
- lantern > lamp
- flute > pipe
- scarab > charm
- cabinet > door
- possessions > all
- talisman > amulet

- take > get 
- throw > give

- wear > don
- place > put
- jump > hop

- use feather on uvula > tickle
