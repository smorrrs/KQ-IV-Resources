Tech used in speedruns of the game


# General

## Quick Text Box Dismissal
Be holding ENTER by the time a dismissable text box appears to immediately dismiss it.

## Leverage Lenient Interaction Distances
Different interactions require different distances to be executed, some of which are very lenient. Use these to your advantage.

Notable examples:
- Give amulet to Genesta from anywhere in her room
- Wear the frog crown anywhere on the waterfall screen
- Give book to minstrel while standing behind him
- Give rattle to baby without moving up

## Screen Transition Warping
Certain screen transitions will move Rosella a certain amount of distance instantly. Routes can leverage these to reduce walking distance.

## Click Prep
During cutscenes/waiting sections, move the mouse cursor to the next location that it will be used.

For example, put the mouse on the yellow hat during the dwarf cutscene to prepare your mouse position for clicking to move up the mountain path.

This can also be done while hopping through the swamp.


# Text Input 

## Synonyms & Efficient Phrasing
Each verb and noun understood by the text input parser has a list of synonyms it will accept in its stead, so choose the shortest and easiest to type synonym for each term. Also, most prepositions and prepositional phrases aren't required.

For example:
- Instead of "take pouch", you can type "get gem"
- Instead of "throw fish to pelican", you can type "give fish"

Notable Noun Replacements:
- pouch > gem
- portrait > picture
- latch > lock
- unicorn > horse
- lantern > lamp
- flute > pipe
- scarab > charm
- cabinet > door
- possessions > all
- talisman > amulet

Notable Verb Replacements:
- take > get 
- throw > give
- wear > don
- place > put
- jump > hop

Notable Phrase Replacements:
- clean house > tidy
- use feather on uvula > tickle
- blow whistle > toot
- swing axe > use ax
- put worm on pole > bait pole
- shoot lolotte > shoot bow

## Quick Typo Recovery
Hit ESCAPE to exit out of the input box, then start retyping your command from the beginning.

## Quick Re-Type
Hit SPACE to bring up the input box filled with the last text that was typed.

## Noun Stacking 
When using the same verb twice in a row, for the second command you can hit SPACE to retype the first command, hit SPACE again, then type the new noun. The parser will only read the last noun used, ignoring the noun of the first command.

For example, "get frog crown" will be interpreted as "get crown".

## Pronoun Replacement
When using the same noun twice in a row, for the second command you can replace the noun with "it". This even works 

For example:
- shoot horse = shoot arrow at unicorn
- bridle it = bridle horse
- ride it = ride horse

This still works with a nounless command used before the second command. For example:
- put board
- hop
- put it


# RNG Mitigation

## Screen Cycling
When you want to encounter or avoid a character with a random chance of appearing when visiting a screen, leave and re-enter the screen until they appear or disappear.

- Worm
- Cupid (1 second to appear)
- Minstrel
- Pan
- Ogre
- Ogress
- Shark (Up to several seconds to appear)
- Whale (2-8 seconds to appear)
- Lord Ghost (Up to several seconds to appear)

## Save Cycling
Save right before the point that RNG determines that something will appear or not, and reload if you get a failure.

- Fish (save 3-4 seconds after starting to fish)
- Feather (save right before visiting a fairy island beach screen for the first time)
- Troll (save right before entering any of the four troll screens)

## RNG Note Taking
RNG encountered earlier in a run can inform actions later in a run. Take a physical and mental note of RNG encountered.

Unicorn
- The unicorn stays in the same location it spawns unless it is scared off-screen. Record where you see it at the beginning of the run to reduce time looking for it later

Pan 
- Pan won't re-appear for 2 minutes after visiting a screen with him there. If you run into him shortly before you need to get his pipe, keep that in mind and come back at a later point in the run to not waste a minute of futile screen cycling.
